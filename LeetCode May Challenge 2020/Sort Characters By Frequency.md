## Sort Characters By Frequency

Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

### Example 1:

```
Input:
"tree"

Output:
"eert"

Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input:
"cccaaa"

Output:
"cccaaa"

Explanation:
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
```

### Example 3:

```
Input:
"Aabb"

Output:
"bbAa"

Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
```

### SOLUTION:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string frequencySort(string s) {
        unordered_map<char, int> count;
        map<int, unordered_set<char>, greater<int>> group;

        for (auto c : s) ++count[c];
        for (auto &p : count) group[p.second].insert(p.first);

        string s2;
        for (auto &p : group)
            for (auto c : p.second)
                s2 += string(p.first, c);

        return s2;
    }
};
```
